# code-quiz

## Description

Using my knowledge of Web APIs and the introduction of DOM, I have used Javascript to create a fully functioning code quiz. The quiz presents a series of coding related multiple choice questions with a countdown timer. Upon completion of the quiz, the user is then able to submit their score with their intials, to save it onto a leaderboard alongside scores from other users.

## Usage

Open the webpage in your browser by following this link: https://tamzinc.github.io/code-quiz/index.html.

Once on the webpage you will be able to see a screen that looks like this:

Click on 'Start Quiz' to get started. This will begin the quiz and you should be presented with your first question and a selection of choices. The countdown timer will also be triggered to start from 60 seconds. It should look something like this:

If you select the correct answer, you will hear the relevant audio and see a message to indicate it's correct. If you choose the wrong answer, you will hear a different audio, a message to indicate it's incorrect and 10 seconds will be deducted from your timer. 

Once you have answered all questions, you will be presented with an end screen. This will show your score (which is the remaining time left on the timer) and be prompted to enter your intials to submit your scores to the leaderboard. It should look like this:

If you click submit after entering your initials, you will be taken to the highscores page. This is where you will be able to see the scores of other users who will have played before you. Clicking on 'Go Back' will take you back to the start of the quiz and 'Clear Highscores' will clear all the current scores saved on the leaderboard.
